# Who am I?

<CMedia :s="img.src" :a="img.src"></CMedia>

## Hi!

My name is Tommaso, I'm 20 years old and I live in Como, Italy. (Edit: now I'm 21)

If I had to describe myself with a few simple adjectives **I'd probably say I'm stubborn, tend to be solitary, and maybe even a bit contentious (someone also suggested resourceful...).** But then again, who isn't at this age?

Many people know me as the one who is always ready to lead the group, to get my hands dirty when there is work to be done, and to joke when there is something to joke about. It is probably also because of this strange combination that my friends have not yet told me to fuck off. They are among those who tell me to be unique, while others tell me that I’m simply incoherent. But I don’t really care.

I probably create a strange effect on the people around me: I feel like many people don’t understand me, and with many others I feel I'm not able to be understood. Others I prefer to look at from a distance as if I had no rights to interfere with their righteous path, and finally there are some people I feel I could really get along with just by looking at them. **I always look for logic in everything and practically always find it,** but inside I wonder if there is any logic at all. I don't know and I don't want to know, otherwise what would be the pleasure in knowing?

**This sense of opposites and countertendency is what mostly guides me through my choices.** The curiosity to try something that no one has ever tried, the satisfaction in saying I succeeded, the desire to continue to learn in order to improve myself and inspire others to improve themselves.

This is, I believe, Tommaso Bocchietti in a few lines, although in reality this page would probably have been more correct if it was written by some friend of mine who really knows me, not by myself. After all, who really knows themselve?

Especially for those who would like to learn more about who I am and/or how I think, I recommend visiting the adventure page by clicking above. Sometimes you can best understand a person by what he does and not by what he says...

## Mechanics

Ever since I was a child, I have had a penchant for anything with gears and complex mechanisms inside it that governed its movement. Probably unconsciously I was simply **looking for logic and rationality**, for something I could control 100% without depending on external variable factors.

I found, and still find, heavy construction equipment such as cranes, trucks and excavators extremely interesting. Especially excavators. They fascinate me a lot because of the fact that they bring mankind significant advantages in terms of mechanical power. **This idea that man is able to increase his workforce by building his own solution by himself is probably what has always attracted me the most to these machines.**

<CMedia s="/v1635371803/Chi%20sono/Escavatore.png" c="Did I mention that I love excavators?"></CMedia>

For all these reasons, I am currently studying _Mechanical Engineering_ at Politecnico di Milano and I hope in the future to be able to contribute actively with my knowledge and passion to the technological development in the fields of heavy mechanics.

## Programming

Obviously mechanics is not my only passion, quite the contrary. Thanks to the high school that I attended (the legendary Paolo Giovio in Como) I was able to have a taste, even if in a very superficial way, of basics of programming, in particular of the good old _C_. Even during my studies, when I still knew little or perhaps any, I had fun programming simple games or similar (like an ugly but of course working version of Connect4).

The wide use of logic in the art of programming is the aspect that fascinates me the most: every time I write code I always feel like I'm trying to solve a rebus or a sudoku. My goal is always to solve the 'game level' with the best strategy, optimizing and speeding up where possible. **Limiting myself to code that does what it's designed to do doesn't give me satisfaction: every single line has to be _clean, tidy and logically linear._**

## And so robotics

If I was asked to choose the field that stimulates me the most, I would answer without a shadow of doubt **robotics and in general the [IoT world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)**. I see it as complete fusion of my two main passions. Thanks to the spread of programmable boards such as Arduino or Raspberry and all the sensors connected to them, it is fortunately very easy for me to experiment and come up with new creations and techniques.

These simple (actually not that simple...) boards offer the **possibility of creating real machines or robots capable, via sensors, of interacting with the external environment.**

## An observer by nature

I remember as if it was yesterday when one of my tennis teachers, seeing me almost always on the sidelines, came up to me and asked me: _Tommy, do you feel more of an active boy or an observer?_, and I replied without thinking much: **_An observer, I like to analyze others and things around me._** Although perhaps as I got older this attitude declined slightly, even now I think it is one of my main characteristics.

Another important aspect that I never miss is contact with nature. **I strongly believe in contact with nature as a source of inspiration for my projects and more.** Many times I find myself looking out of the window, lost in thought, searching for answers to the thousands of questions that pop into my head. Observing and analyzing nature and my surroundings gives me a sense of calm and helps me think better and faster. They say that the night brings counsel, but if you ask me it would probably be more correct to say that _nature brings counsel._

## Sport

This characteristic of mine has also been reflected in my choice of sport. Although it all started casually, for the last five years I have been **practicing [_Orienteering_ or _Orientation running_](https://www.fisolombardia.it/wp/che-cose-lorienteering/).**

<CMedia s="/v1632886357/Chi%20sono/Orienteering.jpg" c="Me during a race"></CMedia>

For the many who may not be familiar with it, this sport consists of searching for control points located in the middle of woods and forests using only a map and a compass. The freedom to choose the route to follow, combined with the context in which it is practiced, makes it one of the most fascinating and complete sports in my opinion. It's a pity that it's little known, but that's another matter.

# To the adventure!

:prose-img{:src="img.src" :alt="img.src" :provider="img.provider"}

This page contains **all those that I define as Adventures**, which are not necessarily heroic feats or moments of danger, but sometimes they are more simply moments that have left a positive impression on me and of which I like to give a summary here, since **they somehow delineate me as a person and attitude**.

For my more interested readers who would like to leave some comments, there is a forum at the bottom of the page!

## Guided by the Moon

If the Moon calls, Bocchio and Mosca answer. If you add the first snow of the year, then the tenting is a must.

Brief reportage of a quick outing on [Monte Bregagno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Bregagno) preceded by a very pleasant dinner with my aunt Anna and Michele (Ah yes, Moscatelli is allergic to dairy products...)

The route trace is [visible here](https://www.strava.com/activities/6292541214).

In the end, without considering the various stops, to go up it took us 2:10h with 5.18km + ~1000m, starting at 23:17 and arriving at the top around 02:50. On the way down quite a lot less, although given the morning warmth, the snow that was icy at night was now melting under our weight, wetting our big feet :(.

Oh yeah, lucky that we had to leave at 6pm!

## London calling

What happens when your friend jokingly says to you: **Why don't we cycle to London?**

It was May 2021 and during an orienteering trip to Bellamonte (TN), my friend Marco Spazio Enterprise came up with this statement which at first seemed to us just for laughs, but it would only take three months to see us actually riding our bikes with compass heading 315.97Â°N.

Towards July in fact, maybe disoriented by university exams, and looking at Google Maps I wrote to Spazio: _You know what? Let's do it!_

Neither of us particularly trained, neither of us particularly used to grinding out long distances on bikes, but both **very determined to succeed in what seemed to everyone to be an impossible feat** (or at least for two runaways like us...).

A [quick test ride](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/7281333384) of the equipment on 10 August around Lake Lugano, a quick look at the statistics of those few kilometres, and the appointment for 1 September 2021 was set. **The rest is history!** Enjoy.

### Video makers are working hard to produce a concise but detailed report. Please wait...

## Tour in Lucca City

Fantastic semi-improvised tour **in search of the sea but above all of So-So**.

After a week decidedly heavier than it should have been, I allowed myself 3 days on the road with my dear green tent and my friend red bike. In spite of the train ride, I still consider it a mission complete, as from the outset my goals were quite different from bike training or climbing to the top of the Apennines.

The butterfly at the end of the video is a _Peacock butterfly_, also known in Italian as _Vanessa io_ or _Occhio di pavone_. The scientific name is [Aglais io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aglais_io), and a local gentleman told us that we were lucky to spot it as it is now increasingly rare to find them around. According to some oriental traditions, it is a symbol of a healthy life and marital happiness.

Fun fact: obviously I hadn't told So-So anything until an hour or so before my arrival... hihihi, surprise :)

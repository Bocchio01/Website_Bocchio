# What's the aim?

<CMedia :s="img.src" :a="img.src"></CMedia>

## A question of needs

It was the beginning of 2021 when a particular need began to arise within me. I was in fact completing the "Gorlu the printer" project and I was realising more and more that through the usual "Facebookian" social media I was finding it difficult to share its features and what I considered to be its strengths. Even trivially with the people who were most likely to be intrigued, **I could not communicate effectively** the content I wanted to pass on.

The only way was to show it directly in person and to create at that moment a whole discourse that would enhance it for what it was. A method actullay worked well, except that I limited the number of people to a very small circle. Even worse, to a circle of people somehow selected by me.

**I simply wanted to try arouse curiosity, maybe start a dialogue or a debate where openly discuss ideas, projects, advice or even receive criticism.** Yes, because it is precisely from criticism that I perhaps learn the most. They spur me on to do better, to make up for or fix my shortcomings. I do little from simple compliments. I always turn criticism into an opportunity for self growth.

## The problem with social media

The various online platforms are made and designed for large numbers: their primary objective is to satisfy the widest possible range of people. The nuances of the individual (obviously) take a back seat.

Social media are therefore not very customisable in terms of how content is published. In particular, they are optimised almost exclusively on the good use of photos and videos, while **text (probably also due to the laziness of modern man who is used to too many comforts) is almost always completely neglected or minimised** to the famous _MAX 256 characters_...

However, I am firmly convinced that text still plays an important role today: if it is well written, I believe it is the best tool to convey large quantities of information in a few lines in an effective and direct manner. On the other hand, I think it is objective to say that watching a video or an image is _less tiring_ than reading a page of text. **But even today, it is necessary and cannot be neglected.**

## The website and freedom of expression

I decided then, once I had finished the printer, to take a break from my list of projects and create a personal website instead. I decided right away not to rely on any ready-made template of some CMS like WordPress or similar, but to start completely from a blank page and thus have the possibility to make that web space 100% mine. Because in the end **if a personal website doesn't reflect the person to whom it belongs, what kind of personal website would it be?**

Right from the beginning everything was **set up so that the main body of the site would be the Articles section**. As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, what I really wanted was to make the reader curious and at the same time give a more or less in-depth description of the project. I therefore created _a page structure with the text as the main element, followed by images and videos._

Once I had created the basic skeleton, I then thought about creating the _forum, which for me is an essential tool for dialogue and the free expression of doubts, questions and curiosity of the reader._

One day, however, I realised the enormous potential that I was not yet exploiting, and so it was born...

## Bocchio's WebSite

With the "Arduino Web Car" project I was in fact starting to write a client that would connect to an external services where my project server was hosted. Right after I started writing the client, it became clear to me that this approach meant that **if anyone wanted to try the project, they would have to download and install** several programming languages and a multitude of additional modules and so on. In short, not great.

The only way to get around this hassle was to move every programme from local to online. Well, **then why not host everything on my own site? And that's how the Portals section** was born, i.e. the set of _all the WebApps needed to take full advantage of the functionalities of some projects._

I then realised the enormous potential that the whole website project had taken on. From a simple noticeboard where I could post a few one-off articles, the site had just become for me an online laboratory where I could experiment and create real applications that **everyone could access easily and immediately, using them in total freedom.**

## In the future

As of today, I have no plans to make substantial changes to either the structure or the contents of the site: I am completely satisfied with the work done so far and my only hope is that it will be appreciated in some way by those who wish to use it.

<div style="display: flex">
  <nuxt-link to="/article/" class="button">Explore articles</nuxt-link>
  <nuxt-link to="/portal/" class="button">Explore portals</nuxt-link>
</div>

For the moment, therefore, there is nothing left to do but to start playing with the site: for this, use the two buttons above. Who knows, _maybe among one of my projects you will find inspiration for your own project..._ good reading!
